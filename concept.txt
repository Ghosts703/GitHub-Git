Git & github is very important. Difference between them?

Git is a version control system. What does it mean?
example:
	We receive a project. Each individual will do a specific job.
	I will do frontend, my friend will do backend, and so on.
	We all did our work. Eventually, we merged our project. Or we pushed our project over github.
	Team collaborate with each other through github.
	Suppose, each individual in a team is sitting in other part of the world. To counter this issue, we use github.
	In software or IT industry, interviewer asks for project or your work, on github.
	Developers push their projects/work on github. Github is very important. Profile/Portfolio of a developer is present over github.
